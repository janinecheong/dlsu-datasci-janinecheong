MY CONFUSION/QUESTION(s) are concerning the portion of the game when you have JUST BUILT/LAID THE CAMPSITE.

So, WHEN do I get the option to ‚ÄúPurchase Plot(s)‚Äù that way I can look for a new villager ON MY OWN whilst there isn‚Äôt a camper there yet. I‚Äôm doing this in real time and have completed all the other things there are up to this point. 

I want to be able to hit a couple mystery islands and also my wife will have one or two available shortly I want..

I wanted to see if there was any sort of pattern or reasons why some villagers are harder to find than others so I collected data from 2024 mystery island tours to see what villagers were the most common and which were the hardest to find. I wrote a short article on what I found if anyone wants to check it out:

I saw a similar post to this one but there were only a few villagers listed, so I decided to go through every villager and pick out the Japanese ones, based on their looks, interior of house and exterior of house. Each villager has a link to an imgur post with all three of those things listed. 

So here is all 19 of them. If you think I‚Äôve missed any villagers just comment them and I will add them to the list. Enjoy!

For context, Nuzlocke is a challenge in the Pok√©mon community that basically says that if one of your Pok√©mon faints, they‚Äôre ‚Äúdead‚Äù and may no longer be used. There are other rules, such as the only Pok√©mon a player can catch on a route is the first encounter. I know it‚Äôs not exactly the same, but the rules are basically this:

- Every time a villager has a thought bubble, the player must talk to them. If the villager wants to leave, you have to let them. 
- However, the flip side is that you either have to wait for the game to randomly assign you a new villager or take the villager from the first island you visit. 
-If there‚Äôs a campsite villager, you have to convince them to move to your island. The first villager that they suggest to leave is the one that leaves. 

The goal would be to try and get as many villager pictures as possible before the villagers try to leave. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôve thought of so far, but if you think of anyway to add to the challenge, please let me know. I figured this challenge might be a good way for people to step up their playing experience if they‚Äôre getting bored.",AnimalCrossing,Animal Crossing: Nuzlocke Edition

So far, I have made;  
\- An N7 hoodie (not strictly metal, but what the Hell).  
\- A classic DOOM logo shirt (because no game franchise is more metal than Doom).  
\- A skeleton print hoodie.

2997,zehgess,1596151778,i0wpxt,19,1,"So, I'm sharing this story due to how incredibly frustrating and unbelievable it has been for me these past two days. I recently moved apartments within the same complex and was unable to find my switch while packing. I assumed I simply left it at my parent's house. This was not the case. After a day of searching to no avail, I decided to use the Nintendo Switch app to see if there was a way to see my last time using the console to determine where I left it and lo and behold I discover this in my passport for AC:NH.

https://imgur.com/gallery/fshGcw1

Kevin, a person who I do not know unfortunately, added himself as a villager within my island on my stolen switch. I discovered this yesterday evening and I'm still at a loss for words. I have been checking fairly frequently and the man has already claimed a dream ID as well. I had a friend of mine go check the island via dream just to make absolutely sure that someone else was using it and yes changes to the island have been made as well as the presence of construction showing that they've played recently. I was hoping with the introduction of dreams that my friend would be able to contact the guy, but that is additionally, unfortunately not the case.

I have contacted Nintendo support to see what options I have available. They do in fact have the IP address from the last time the Switch connected to the internet which must have been recently due to the presence of a dream code, but they cannot provide it to me due to privacy policies and can only do so to the police. So I contacted my campus police and they took a statement as well the serial code of the switch and at this point I can only hope they will contact Nintendo to get the IP address associated and then the ISP associated to the IP address to get the physical address of the person who stole my switch. This is of course assuming that the IP used is static and not dynamic and whether or not my local PD is actually willing to go through all that trouble over a video game console.

The only other option I have at the moment is to request Nintendo to de-link my account from that switch, but I feel once that is done the odds of me ever getting the console back would be 0. I'm going to have to fairly soon though since I do in fact have my credit card linked to that Nintendo account! All in all, I'm still quite taken back that this has all happened and I really don't know what the best course of action is and I'd just like to at-least put this out in written form for my own sanity.

I read the rules and I'm not positive if this would fall under non-allowed content so I apologize in advance if it does.",AnimalCrossing,My Switch was stolen from my apartment 3 weeks ago and the guy added themselves as a villager on my island.

3198,EmeraldMars,1596309384,i1xtkr,0,1,"Hey everyone! I was curious to see who everyone like as a villager and what are the popular ones. I know there‚Äôs other surveys and chats of popular villagers but I want this for my own research. I have posted this in r/nofeeac r/animalcrossingnewhor and r/buddycrossing 

So there is ten parts but it‚Äôs for each personality type and for NPCs so you can vote for allll the ones you like! Hopefully I have added all the villagers available, if not sorry :(

Google form: https://forms.gle/NMoY2KnDcJKQGGXj9

I know the how long you‚Äôve played was very general but it‚Äôs a chance to write your estimates because not many always put straight answers. 

At the end you can see the over all data too if you‚Äôd like! 

But of course this is a discussion! If you‚Äôd like to talk about why you do or don‚Äôt like villagers let me know in the comments! I always love hearing funny stories so feel free to share! If this gets attention I might do a ‚Äúleast liked villagers‚Äù to see.",AnimalCrossing,Ultimate favorite villager and NPC survey! Read below!!
